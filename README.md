This C# console application showcases the implementation of basic array operations such as finding the maximum element, reversing the array, and calculating the sum of array elements.

## Tasks
### Task 1: Finding Maximum Element
In this task, the program prompts the user to enter the size of the array and then input array elements. It then finds and displays the maximum element in the array.

### Task 2: Reversing an Array
This task demonstrates how to reverse an array in place. It takes an array as input, reverses it, and prints the reversed array.

### Task 3: Calculating Sum of Array Elements
In this task, the program calculates the sum of all elements in the array and displays the result.

## Usage
To run the application, follow these steps:

- Open the solution in Visual Studio Code or your preferred C# IDE.
- Build the solution.
- Run the .cs file.
